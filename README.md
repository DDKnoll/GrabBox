GrabBox
=======

A browser-based single page app editor.

*GrabBox is currently in developement*

## Workflow

### Step 1: Build an Application (Beta)

Grabbox is designed to quickly edit and publish web apps.  Just grab a .gbx file
and load it into the editor.  Viol√°, you have a functional application.
The file is created in the GrabBox editing mode, where you can write code
and immediately see the result.

### Step 2: Download your app

Get a simple Node.JS server running on your machine.
1. Install Node.JS Framework
2. Download GrabBox Files (Unfinished)
`wget path to grabbox`
3. Click the "Save" button on your GrabBox app and save to the /boxes/ folder
4. Run the app
`node app.js`

### Step 3: Deploy Anywhere

Once you have a functional GrabBox app, you can deploy it on any hosting
platform. It is that simple.
